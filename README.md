# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## The Task

This week’s homework was to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected by modifying starter code.

Utilizing functions, arrays, loops, and other dynamic JS, this was accomplished. Users are prompted to select a password length, along with a set of variables to choose from for the password components. Once the user answers the questions and hits the button, a random password is generated using JS functions.
